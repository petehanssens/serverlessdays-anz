        "description": "Domain Driven Design (DDD) is all about aligning software design with the business domain, helping developers build systems that accurately reflect real-world processes and requirements. /n/n/n In this talk, we'll explore how to apply DDD patterns in a serverless context. Specifically, we'll look at mapping bounded contexts to serverless components, managing long running processes (aka sagas) and using serverless messaging capabilities for practical event-driven architecture, including a comparison between event streaming vs message queues for DDD-style business events. /n/n/n Whether you're an experienced DDD practitioner or new to the concept, you'll walk away with valuable insights and strategies for building better software using these complementary approaches.",
