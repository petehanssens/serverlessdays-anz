            "abstract" : "The emergence of microservices made us rethink how we built business applications. It led us to the migration of complex monolith applications to countless microservices. The adoption of the cloud and the suitability of container services helped revolutionize microservices.\n\nAmidst this adoration for microservices came serverless, the next evolution of the cloud. Serverless brought deeper granularity with its technology offering. It tested our thinking, shifted our minds, and questioned the way weâ€™ve been building microservices. The agility of event-driven computing and the granularity of serverless allow us to break traditional application development into multiple pieces.\n\nIn this talk, we will see how cloud and serverless help us create a set-piece thinking and build those pieces in isolation to achieve acceleration in our modern application development process."

We will look into the technical details for how to set up a Lambda webhook, an SQS reader and a Lambda that then processes data from SQS and loads it into DynamoDB. This pipeline keeps up with events coming in every microsecond and data updates almost immediately PLUS does not cost an arm and a leg.\n\nWhen building a data pipeline, you must think about how/when/why the data is used so you can build a platform that is fit for purpose and your budget. Sometimes the simplest solution is best.\n\nTechnologies we will cover: AWS Lambda, AWS SQS, AWS Dynamodb, Terraform, Typescript"
