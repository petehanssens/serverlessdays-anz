            "abstract" : "The emergence of microservices made us rethink how we built business applications. It led us to the migration of complex monolith applications to countless microservices. The adoption of the cloud and the suitability of container services helped revolutionize microservices.\n\nAmidst this adoration for microservices came serverless, the next evolution of the cloud. Serverless brought deeper granularity with its technology offering. It tested our thinking, shifted our minds, and questioned the way weâ€™ve been building microservices. The agility of event-driven computing and the granularity of serverless allow us to break traditional application development into multiple pieces.\n\nIn this talk, we will see how cloud and serverless help us create a set-piece thinking and build those pieces in isolation to achieve acceleration in our modern application development process."
